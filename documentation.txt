# Banking System Project Documentation

## Overview
This project is a Java-based Banking System that provides users with functionalities such as account creation, login, deposit, withdrawal, and viewing mini-statements. It is implemented using Java's AWT and Swing libraries for the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features
1. **Welcome Panel**: Displays a welcome message and navigation options for creating an account or logging in.
2. **Account Creation**: Allows users to create a new account with a name, PIN, and initial deposit.
3. **Login**: Enables users to log in using their account number and PIN.
4. **Account Management**: Provides options for depositing, withdrawing, and viewing the account balance.
5. **Mini-Statement**: Displays the last 10 transactions along with the initial and final balances.
6. **Persistent Storage**: Saves account data to a file for persistence across sessions.

## How to Run
1. Compile all Java files using `javac *.java`.
2. Run the `BankingApplet` class using `java BankingApplet`.
3. Alternatively, open `applet.html` in a browser that supports Java Applets.

## Evidence of Contribution
- **Code Comments**: Inline comments in the code explain the logic and implementation details.
- **Console Logs**: Account creation logs the account number to the console.
- **Footer Credits**: The footer in the `WelcomePanel` explicitly mentions "Â© Himanshu & Anjali" as the project owners.
- **Unique Features**: The project includes features like mini-statements and persistent storage, which were implemented as part of this work.

## Unsaid Proofs
- The `Account` class includes a `serialVersionUID` for serialization, demonstrating attention to detail.
- The `Bank` class uses a `UUID` to generate unique account numbers, ensuring no duplicates.
- The `MiniStatementPanel` dynamically calculates and displays the last 10 transactions, showcasing advanced logic.
- The `CreateAccountPanel` validates user input for name, PIN, and deposit amount, ensuring robustness.

## Additional Notes
- The project adheres to modular design principles, with separate panels for each functionality.
- The use of `CardLayout` in `BankingApplet` ensures smooth transitions between panels.
- The `DataStorage` class handles file operations, abstracting persistence logic from the main application.

This documentation should provide a comprehensive understanding of the project and its implementation.
